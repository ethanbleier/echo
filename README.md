# echo


 A multiplayer FPS where sound is both your weapon and your enemy. Players wield sonic rifles that fire pulses, which grow deadlier with each bounce, but every shot reveals your position to opponents who can track the noise. It’s a mix of stealth, strategy, and chaotic shootouts in tight, reflective arenas.

## Core Mechanics

  * Sonic Arsenal: Everyone starts with a base sonic rifle. Pulses deal low damage on direct hits (say, 20HP), but each bounce off a wall or object adds power (up to 100HP after 3-4 ricochets). You aim for trick shots—banking pulses around corners or through tunnels—to catch foes off guard.

   * Sound Tracking: Every shot emits a visible soundwave (a faint ripple on-screen) and an audible ping that enemies can hear. Skilled players can pinpoint your location by sound alone, so firing is a calculated risk. Silence is your shield.

  * Environmental Play: Maps are littered with materials that affect pulses—metal walls amplify damage and range, glass shatters for one-time big booms, and soft surfaces (like moss or curtains) dampen shots entirely. Players learn the terrain to dominate.

## Multiplayer Modes

   *  Resonance Deathmatch (4-8 players): Free-for-all chaos. Most kills in 10 minutes wins. Maps are small, with crisscrossing corridors and reflective surfaces to encourage wild ricochet plays. Quiet players stalk, loud ones brawl—your style decides your fate.
   
  * Echo Hunt (2v2 or 3v3): Team-based elimination. One team starts with a “beacon” (a pulsing objective that emits faint noise). Defenders protect it while attackers use sound cues to locate and destroy it. First to three wins. Stealth versus aggression in tense rounds.
  * 
  * Amplify King (6 players): King of the Hill with a twist—a central zone boosts your sonic pulses’ power and range while you hold it. Everyone hears your shots louder, making you a target. Hold the zone longest without dying to win, balancing offense and defense.

## Extra Flavor

  * Upgrades & Gadgets: Scavenge in-match for mods like a “mute shot” (one silent pulse), a decoy emitter (throws fake sound elsewhere), or a high-frequency burst (short-range AOE stun). Keeps matches dynamic.
    
  * Audio Cues: Headphones are king—3D sound design lets you hear shots and footsteps with eerie precision. A good player can “see” the map through sound alone.

  * Maps: Think industrial labyrinths, abandoned concert halls, or crystal caves—places where sound bounces and distorts. Maybe a map with a central gong that, if shot, deafens everyone for 10 seconds (chaos ensues).
